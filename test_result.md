# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Tested the backend API endpoints and they are working correctly. The admin login functionality is implemented entirely in the frontend without backend API support. The anti-flickering system is implemented using React.memo for component memoization, debounced input handlers, CSS containment with ultra-stable classes, and event isolation. The admin credentials (admin/pandamodz2024) are hardcoded in the frontend code."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "FIXED: Secure Admin Access typing flickering issue. Applied comprehensive anti-flickering solution with React.memo component memoization, debounced input handlers (handleUsernameChange, handlePasswordChange), ultra-stable CSS classes throughout the admin login form, enhanced form group stability with minimum heights to prevent layout shifts, and advanced CSS containment properties. All input fields now use ultra-stable-input class with comprehensive browser-specific optimizations for zero visual instability during typing."

Removed AdminPanel component, complex security features (lockouts, session timers, warnings), enterprise-grade features, and multi-tab admin interface. Implemented simple LoginModal with basic username/password validation, floating login button, user indicator in navigation, and logout functionality. Maintained clean PANDA_MODZ styling while drastically simplifying the user experience. Login credentials remain admin/pandamodz2024 for consistency."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Tested the PANDA_MODZ website frontend. The website loads successfully with proper background images in the hero section. Navigation between sections works correctly. The website is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes. Discord links and YouTube integration are present in the UI. However, I was unable to access the admin login functionality during testing - the admin button appears to be present in the code but was not accessible in the testing environment. Based on code review, the anti-flickering system is well-implemented with React.memo for component memoization, debounced input handlers, and comprehensive CSS optimizations including the ultra-stable-input class with containment properties."
